## About
This repository is a collection of notes for the class **420-614-GR SÉCURITÉ DE L'INFORMATION**, offered during the **Winter 2025 semester** at **Cégep de Granby**. Since the professor does not provide explicit notes, this repository serves as a collaborative resource for students to study from.

## Repository Organization
Notes are organized into class-specific subdirectories. For example:
- Notes from **Class 1** will be located in the `./class1` directory.
- Notes for the **"Typical Menace" presentation** in Class 3 will be located in `./class3/menace`.

Additional resources for presentations can be found in the `./presentations` directory.

If you have suggestions for improving the organization, don't hesitate to open an issue with your proposal!
