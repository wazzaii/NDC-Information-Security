Control unclassified informations
It's a standard you must respect if you want to work with a government agency (US now, Canada soon)

# Trust
Important to note, the key concept in cybersecurity is **TRUST**. As boring as it is, 
in the context of any interraction, you need to assume an arbitrary entity is trustworthy, 
or the interraction won't achieve anything. 

In an IRL interraction (face to face), you usually assume that your interlocutor's information 
is trustworthy, otherwise, you would simply ignore it. The same in the *cyberspace* (what a shit term).

Now the model behind the trust system might be complex and abstract, but it should always stand
true.
