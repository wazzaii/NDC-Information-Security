always double check any info they provide

## [umbreslla threats types and definitions](https://umbrella.cisco.com/trends-threats/cyber-threat-categories-and-definitions#level-2-threat-types)
annoying chatbot when you try to browse :(
I like the way they did a taxonomic classification of threats / menaces. 
- Threat categories 
    - Threat type
        - Individual threat
        
Fun note : they have their IP adress in the footer instead of their phisical adress.
